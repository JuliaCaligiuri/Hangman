# Hangman

## Welcome!
Hangman is a python application that runs hangman minigames, allowing the user to choose between a list of themes before generating a word. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the hangman board updates to reflect the amount of incorrect guesses. After  8 incorrect guesses, the hangman is completed and the game has been lost. 

I created this project to utilize previously-learned programming skills in a fun and simple manner, along with the ability to provide my family and friends entertainment.

## Future Updates
This is a completed project, however there are ways in which Hangman can be further developed. Some ideas include:
- Implementing easy and hard game modes
- Adding and diversifying themes
- Creating an interactible interface
